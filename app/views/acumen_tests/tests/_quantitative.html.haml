%p
  There are a number of ways to increase your net worth:
%ul
  %li Appreciation of assets (for example, a rise in the value of stocks, bonds, funds, and real estate)
  %li Reducing liabilities. This also reduces the amount of interest payments made to service the debt
  %li Increasing your income, such as through salary and wage increases, and increases in investment income
  %li Reducing the amount spent on living expenses
%p
  BEWARE! Increasing your assets may not always increase your net worth.
  This is especially true with depreciating assets, such as automobiles, computers, home entertainment systems, etc.
